In particular, a reasonably conspicuous visual indicator must be displayed to the user as part of the Application to indicate that a Recording is taking place.\n\
(g) Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations, including those in any jurisdictions in which Your Applications may be offered or made available.  In addition, for Applications that use location-based APIs or that collect, transmit, maintain, process, share, disclose or otherwise use a user's personal information or data: (i) You and the Application must comply with all applicable privacy and data collection laws and regulations with respect to any collection, transmission, maintenance, processing, use, etc. of the user's location data or personal information by the Application; (ii) Applications may not be designed or marketed for the purpose of harassing, abusing, stalking, threatening or otherwise violating the legal rights (such as the rights of privacy and publicity) of others. (iii) Applications may not perform any functions or link to any content or use any robot, spider, site search or other retrieval application or device to scrape, retrieve or index services provided by SAMSUNG or its licensors, or to collect, disseminate or use information about users for any unauthorized purpose.\n\
(h) For Applications that use location-based APIs, such Applications may not be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicles, aircraft, or other mechanical devices; dispatch or fleet management; or emergency or life-saving purposes.  In addition Applications that offer location-based services or functionality must notify and obtain consent from an individual before his or her location data is being collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application.\n\
(i) For Applications that use location-based APIs for real-time route guidance, You must have an end user license agreement that includes the following notice:  YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.\n\

If consent is denied or withdrawn, Applications may not collect, transmit, maintain, process or utilize the user's location data or perform any other actions for which the user's consent has been denied or withdrawn.\n\
(k) Any master recordings and musical compositions embodied in Your Application must be wholly-owned by You or licensed to You on a fully paid-up basis and in a manner that will not require the payment of any fees, royalties and/or sums by SAMSUNG to You or any third party.

(o) If Your Application includes any Open Source Software, You agree to comply with all applicable Open Source Software licensing terms. You also agree not to use any Open Source Software in the development of Your Application in such a way that would cause the non-Open Source Software portions of the SDK/IDE to be subject to any Open Source Software licensing terms or obligations.\n\
(p) If an Application requires or will have access to the cellular network, then additionally such Application (1) must not in SAMSUNG's reasonable judgment, excessively use or unduly burden network capacity or bandwidth; and (ii) may not have Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) functionality using the cellular network.\n\

You may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify SAMSUNG of such requirement before disclosing the Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment against disclosure of the Confidential Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, SAMSUNG is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.\n\
\n\
4.3 To avoid potential misunderstandings, SAMSUNG cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information or technology that You may provide in connection with this Agreement, including information about Your Application (such disclosures will be referred to as "Licensee Disclosures"). You agree that any such Licensee Disclosures will be non-confidential. SAMSUNG will be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You.

YOUR UNDERSTSANDING, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS ARE THE LEGAL BASIS AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE LICENSES GRANTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
\n\

\n\
7. Indemnification\n\
\n\
To the extent permitted by law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless SAMSUNG, its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an "SAMSUNG Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation attorneys fees and court costs) (collectively "Losses") incurred by a SAMSUNG Indemnified Party as a result of Your (or Your Authorized Users') breach of this Agreement, any claims that Your Applications violate or infringe any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from Your (or Your Authorized Users') use of the SDK/IDE, Your Application(s) or Your (or Your Authorized Users') development distribution of Applications.
